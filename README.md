# CarND-LaneLines-P1

The goal of this first project was to **create a simple pipeline to detect road lines** in a frame taken from a roof-mounted camera.

Being the very first project, the pipeline is necessarily very simple. No machine learning is involved - just **computer vision** and a lot of *boring manual parameter tuning*. :-)

A short demo [videoclip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=KlQ-8iD1EFM) (of a success case): can be found here:

In this repo you will find before and after videos of rough lane line
detection, the source code in a Jupyter Notebook, and a write up explaining the pipeline process.
