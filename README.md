# CarND-LaneLines-P1
This is the first project in the Udacity Self Driving Car ND program.
In this project it was required to create a rough pipeline for lane line
detection. In this repo you will find before and after videos of rough lane line
detection, the source code in a Jupyter Notebook, and a write up explaining the pipeline process.
